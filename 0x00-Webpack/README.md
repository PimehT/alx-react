# 0x00. Webpack

This project aims at learning how to use Webpack to bundle JavaScript files. With Webpack, we can bundle all our JavaScript files into a single file, which can be included in our HTML file.

## Learning Objectives

- How to setup Webpack for a basic project
- Entry points, output, and loaders
- How to add plugins
- How to split your code into chunks
- How to setup a dev server

## Tasks

- Task 0: Basic setup of webstack. npm is used to install `webpack` and `webpack-cli` as developer dependencies, and `jquery` as a regular dependency. `jqwery` is then imported and used to modify the text of a paragraph in the HTML file.

- Task 1: Create a package.js using `npm init -y` and modify it to include a script that runs webpack in development mode.
Using jquery, modify the text of a paragraph in the HTML file.

- Task 2: Create a webpack.config.js file to support adding images to the css file.

- Task 3: Setup a development server, divide the code into modules.
